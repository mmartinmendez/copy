venue: One of the choir member's house
qdescription: >-
  On Wednesday evenings we have choir practices in one of the choir members
  house. It is a chance for us to take a break away from the routines of the
  week and relax and enjoy some good songs. Sometimes one of us will surprise
  the rest with a new song from their country. This often goes into the choir
  book so that the people who continues on can enjoy them as well.

  If you want to be part of the choir and be informed about the other choir
  related activities send us an email and we can include you in the choir
  emails.

  Disclaimer: We are not professionals and solely do it for fun and to get
  better. So anyone who wants to try it out are welcome.

As an international community, we are blessed with a lot of songs and sounds from different countries across the globe. The ISC choir learns songs brought by our community members to bring a little piece of everyone's home in the community. Some of us who are less experienced in singing or playing music also learn to be better singers and instrument players. :)

We sing on Wednesday evenings, usually at members' houses, and have a lot of fun! Those of us who can make it to the Sunday service, usually sing in the service. We also have other occasional activities, such as singing workshop, choir retreat, and Christmas caroling to help us grow and spread our joy with others.

If you are interested in joining us, please email: choir.isc@gmail.com. You are also welcome to participate in the non-regular activities. Just reach out to us, and we will let you know more details.
