venue: One of the choir member's house
qdescription: >-
  On Wednesday evenings we have choir practices in one of the choir members
  house. It is a chance for us to take a break away from the routines of the
  week and relax and enjoy some good songs. Sometimes one of us will surprise
  the rest with a new song from their country. This often goes into the choir
  book so that the people who continues on can enjoy them as well.

  If you want to be part of the choir and be informed about the other choir
  related activities send us an email and we can include you in the choir
  emails.

  Disclaimer: We are not professionals and solely do it for fun and to get
  better. So anyone who wants to try it out are welcome.
