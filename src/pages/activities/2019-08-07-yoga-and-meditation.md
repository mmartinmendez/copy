As students, and professionals, we often find ourselves in the middle of a hectic life. Everyday can feel like a race from one activity to another; fulfilling tasks and obligations, attending to calls and appointments. There are of course many ways to entertain ourselves, and make our life a little bit more balanced, but sometimes we may still feel drained and empty. Somewhere deep down, we start to think that we need a calm 'room' for ourselves.
