  This is where we pray on Sundays, this is where students from many nations
  discover that they are not alone in a strange land, this is what we have been
  calling; Home away from Home! since 1981.

  "In this strange and distant land

  the world prays hand in hand!"

  Come see us each and every Sunday and do not feel shy to bring a friend.
  Shared prayers are a smile to the Lord and consolation to family and friends
  far away
